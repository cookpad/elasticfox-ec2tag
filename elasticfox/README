Source Code:

The full source code is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/elasticfox/

The .xpi file is really just a renamed ZIP archive. Your garden variety ZIP utilities can be 
used to unzip it. Within this archive you will find a file named ec2ui.jar. This is also just
a renamed JAR archive so you can explore it in the same way. This JAR file contains the bulk
of the interesting source code. Highlights include:

  content/ec2ui/client.js
    This file contains the logic to construct and sign requests to Amazon EC2.

  content/ec2ui/controller.js
    This file wraps client.js and includes logic to unpack Amazon EC2 responses.
